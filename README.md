# About the user documentation

## **About the  user documentation**

Here is the [repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/user-documentation-es) where you will find the Spanish documentation on how to create, maintain, and make the most of a PrestaShop online store.

It hosts the 1.7 documentation on how to install PrestaShop and use each page of the back office. This documentation is also available in 6 other languages.

Here are the links to the 5 other repositories:

[English](https://github.com/PrestaShop/user-documentation-en)

[French](https://github.com/PrestaShop/user-documentation-fr)

[Italian](https://github.com/PrestaShop/user-documentation-it)

[Dutch](https://github.com/PrestaShop/user-documentation-nl)

[Farsi](https://github.com/PrestaShop/user-documentation-fa)

This repository is synchronized with GitBook, a tool that allows creating modern and intuitive documentation pages. You can find the PrestaShop Spanish repository [here](https://prestashop.gitbook.io/documentacion-espanola-para-prestashop-1-7/).

Consequently, both interfaces (GitBook and GitHub) are open to contributions.

By saying that this repository is synchronized with GitBook’s documentation, it means that edited contents are updated in real-time in GitHub and GitBook. If you change the content of any page on GitBook, your edits will be pushed to this repository. Conversely, commits pushed to this repository are imported on GitBook.

### If you want to work using GitHub and edit a file

This option is particularly adapted if you are not used to working on GitHub yet.

1. Create your GitHub account, if you do not have one already.
2. Browse to the target file.
3. Click the "Edit" button and make your changes in the editor.‌
4. Once you are done, go to the bottom of the page, enter a name and a description and click on "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."
5. Finally, click on "Propose file change". GitHub will automatically create a new fork and branch on your own GitHub account, then suggest a pull request to this repository. &#x20;
6. Once the pull request is submitted, just wait for the product content manager to come back to you.

Please do not commit your changes directly. It is important to create a pull request so that your work can be proofread.

### If you feel comfortable working with Git and forking the project

This option is particularly adapted if you already work on GitHub or if you feel comfortable doing so.

1. Create your GitHub account, if you do not have one already.
2. Fork this repository to your Github account.
3. Clone your fork to your local machine.
4. Create a branch in your local clone for your changes.
5. Change the files in your branch.
6. Push the changed branch to your fork in your GitHub account.
7. Create a pull request for your changes. If you need help to make a pull request, read the GitHub help page about[ creating pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
8. Wait for the product content manager to either include your change in the codebase or comment on possible adjustments.

### If you want to submit an issue using GitHub

An idea, a suggestion? Let the community know by [submitting a new issue](https://github.com/PrestaShop/user-documentation-es/issues)!

This is a ticket-tracker for the user documentation repository and it is the best place to write a suggestion or request an improvement. For that, you will just need a GitHub account.

### If you want to contribute using Gitbook

‌Gitbook is a tool to build documentation. It works like a text editor and might be easier to use if you are not tech-savvy. To contribute to the PrestaShop documentation using GitBook, please send us an email to documentation@prestashop.com with a little introduction of yourself:

Are you a merchant? In which language would you like to translate, update, or write? What motivates you to participate in this project?

PrestaShop's Product Content Manager will onboard you and will give you access to the documentation as a writer. You will have to log in with either a Gmail, GitHub, or GitBook account. Click here to[ create a GitBook account](https://app.gitbook.com/join).

Once you have chosen the way to contribute that suits you best, you are ready to participate in the PrestaShop open source project. Thank you for your contribution!
